Starfish documentation
======================

*Starfish* is a framework used for robust spectroscopic inference. While this package was designed around the need to infer stellar properties such as effective temperature :math:`T_{\rm eff}`, surface gravity :math:`\log(g)`, and metallicity :math:`[{\rm Fe}/{\rm H}]` from high resolution spectra, the framework could easily be adapted to any type of model spectra: galaxy spectra, supernovae spectra, or spectra of unresolved stellar clusters. For an introduction to the problems that *Starfish* solves, please see `our website <http://iancze.github.io/Starfish>`_. For more technical information, please see  `our paper <http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5177>`_.
