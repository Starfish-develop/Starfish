<f_lam> = integrate(f_lam * S * wl) / integrate(S * wl)

This is converting f_lam to proportional to photons (since S in pysynphot is indeed a photonic passband), and seeing
how many photons it counts. Basically, it is taking the photon-weighted average of f_lam.

S(λ) is the dimensionless bandpass throughput function, and the division by hν = hc / λ converts the energy flux to a
photon flux as is appropriate for photon-counting detectors. (ie, this is independent of the passband function).

For speed, this means we could pre-evaluate the numerator, and scale S such that the integral becomes normalized.
