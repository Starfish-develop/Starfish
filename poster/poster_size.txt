When preparing your poster, remember to use bold graphs, photographs, figures, and tables. Include a title and the names of authors in large type. Text should be large enough to be legible from a distance of three to four feet, ~ 20 point font. Keep the poster simple and easy to read. For further recommendations read, How Do You Prepare A Research Poster? on the-aps.org website.
There is also a good article on preparing an eye-catching poster at naturejobs.com, Presentations: Billboard Science.
Consider posting a photo of yourself with your presentation.
